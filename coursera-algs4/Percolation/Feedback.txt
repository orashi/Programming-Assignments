Testing methods in Percolation
*-----------------------------------------------------------
Running 15 total tests.

Tests 1 through 8 create a Percolation object using your code, then repeatedly
open sites by calling open(). After each call to open(), we check the return
values of isOpen(i, j) for every (i, j), the return value of percolates(),
and the return value of isFull(i, j) for every (i, j), in that order.

Except as noted, a site is opened at most once.

Test 1: Open predetermined list of sites using file inputs
  *  filename = input6.txt
  *  filename = input8.txt
  *  filename = input8-no.txt
  *  filename = input10-no.txt
  *  filename = greeting57.txt
  *  filename = heart25.txt
==> passed

Test 2: Open random sites until just before system percolates
  *  N = 3
  *  N = 5
  *  N = 10
  *  N = 10
  *  N = 20
  *  N = 20
  *  N = 50
  *  N = 50
==> passed

Test 3: Opens predetermined sites for N = 1 and N = 2 (corner case test)
  *  filename = input1.txt
     percolates() returns wrong value [after 1 site opened]
     - student   = false
     - reference = true
     - failed after call 1 to isOpen()
  *  filename = input1-no.txt
  *  filename = input2.txt
  *  filename = input2-no.txt
==> FAILED

Test 4: Check for backwash with predetermined sites
  *  filename = input20.txt
  *  filename = input10.txt
  *  filename = input50.txt
  *  filename = jerry47.txt
==> passed

Test 5: Check for backwash with predetermined sites that have
        multiple percolating paths
  *  filename = input3.txt
  *  filename = input4.txt
  *  filename = input7.txt
==> passed

Test 6: Predetermined sites with long percolating path
  *  filename = snake13.txt
  *  filename = snake101.txt
==> passed

Test 7: Opens every site
  *  filename = input5.txt
==> passed

Test 8: Open random sites until just before system percolates,
        allowing open() to be called on a site more than once
  *  N = 3
  *  N = 5
  *  N = 10
  *  N = 10
  *  N = 20
  *  N = 20
  *  N = 50
  *  N = 50
==> passed

Test 9: Check that IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if (i, j) is out of bounds
  *  N = 10, (i, j) = (0, 6)
  *  N = 10, (i, j) = (12, 6)
  *  N = 10, (i, j) = (11, 6)
  *  N = 10, (i, j) = (6, 0)
  *  N = 10, (i, j) = (6, 12)
  *  N = 10, (i, j) = (6, 11)
==> passed

Test 10: Check that IllegalArgumentException is thrown if N <= 0 in constructor
  *  N = -10
  *  N = -1
  *  N = 0
==> passed

Test 11: Create multiple Percolation objects at the same time
         (to make sure you didn't store data in static variables)
==> passed

Test 12: Open predetermined list of sites using file inputs,
         but change the order in which methods are called
  *  filename = input8.txt;  order =     isFull(),     isOpen(), percolates()
  *  filename = input8.txt;  order =     isFull(), percolates(),     isOpen()
  *  filename = input8.txt;  order =     isOpen(),     isFull(), percolates()
  *  filename = input8.txt;  order =     isOpen(), percolates(),     isFull()
  *  filename = input8.txt;  order = percolates(),     isOpen(),     isFull()
  *  filename = input8.txt;  order = percolates(),     isFull(),     isOpen()
==> passed

Test 13: Call all methods in random order until just before system percolates
  *  N = 3
  *  N = 5
  *  N = 7
  *  N = 10
  *  N = 20
  *  N = 50
==> passed

Test 14: Call all methods in random order until almost all sites are open,
         but with inputs not prone to backwash
  *  N = 3
  *  N = 5
  *  N = 7
  *  N = 10
  *  N = 20
  *  N = 50
==> passed

Test 15: Call all methods in random order until all sites are open,
         allowing isOpen() to be called on a site more than once
         (these inputs are prone to backwash)
  *  N = 3
  *  N = 5
  *  N = 7
  *  N = 10
  *  N = 20
  *  N = 50
==> passed

Running time in seconds depends on the machine on which the script runs,
and  varies each time that you submit. If one of the values in the table
violates the performance limits, the factor by which you failed the test
appears in parentheses. For example, (9.6x) in the union() column
indicates that it uses 9.6x too many calls.


Tests 2a-2d: Check whether number of calls to union(), connected(), and find()
             is a constant per call to open(), isFull(), and percolates().
             The table shows the maximum number of union(), connected(), and
             find() calls made during a single call to open(), isFull(), and
             percolates().
